Prestige Pricing: Rounding prices up (e.g., $200 instead of $199.99) can make products seem more premium or high-quality. Anchor Pricing: Presenting a higher priced item next to a more affordable option can make the latter seem like a great deal in comparison.

Price Above Competitors: Justifiable if you\'re offering superior value, such as better quality products, additional services, or a stronger brand. Competitive analysis helps you position your brand in the market and target your desired customer segment effectively.

Thats right, its a norm in the developer community to always encrypt user data before storing in your database in case of hacks.
